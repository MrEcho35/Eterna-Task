# Conversion Prediction API ðŸš€

This API leverages the Prophet model to forecast conversion counts. 

## Key Features:
- Time-series forecasting using Prophet.
- FastAPI-based REST API for easy integration.
- Redis caching for faster predictions.
- Highly customizable and easy to deploy.

## Overview

This Conversion Prediction API provides accurate and efficient forecasting. Mainly implemented for 7 days forecasting but can be used for any amount of days.

## Requirements

To run this API, you'll need the following:

- **Python 3.8+**: Make sure you have Python 3.8 or above installed.
- **FastAPI**: A modern web framework for building APIs.
- **Prophet**: A tool for forecasting time-series data.
- **Redis**: Required for caching. In order to program to work Redis Server and Redis CLI must be running in the background. You can install Redis using the following link: [Redis for Windows](https://github.com/microsoftarchive/redis/releases).

## Installation Steps
